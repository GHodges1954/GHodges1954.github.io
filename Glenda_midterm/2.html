             <p>My Red Line experience began early one Tuesday Morning. I had difficulty sleeping because I truly did not know what to expect. I parked my car at the Lincoln Park Campus and followed the other students, parroting what they did. I swiped my Ventra card and headed up the stairs. I had read online to take the 95th Street train to Jackson. It was a breeze.</p> 
            <p>After my loop classes were over, I headed back to Lincoln Park for an evening class. Unfortunately, a rather inebriated fellow had urinated on the floor near where he was sleeping. Prior to exiting, he urinated again for good measure. <b>Welcome</b> to the Red Line.</p>

                 <p>On Monday, May 6, the evening news stations report that a 14-year-old had shot two men on the Argyle Red Line Platform. After entering the Fullerton Station, the following day, I'm shocked to discover a total lack of security. So, imagine my surprise Tuesday, May 20, to see my first police officer and her muzzled dog on the train. </p>
