             <p>My Red Line experience began early one Tuesday Morning. The night before I had difficulty sleeping. I did not know what to expect. After parking my car at the Lincoln Park Campus, I followed the other students, parroting what they did. I swiped my Ventra card and headed up the stairs. After reading  instructions online, I knew to take the 95th Street train to Jackson. It was a breeze.</p> 
            <p>After my loop classes were over, I headed back to Lincoln Park for an evening class. Unfortunately, a rather inebriated man had urinated on the floor near where he was sleeping. He awoke, and before exiting, he urinated again for good measure. <b>Welcome</b> to the Red Line.</p>

                 <p>On Monday, May 6, the evening news reported that a 14-year-old shot two men on the Argyle Red Line Platform. The next day after entering the Fullerton Station, I was furious to discover a total lack of security. Imagine my surprise on Tuesday, May 20, to see my first police officer and her muzzled dog on the train. </p>
