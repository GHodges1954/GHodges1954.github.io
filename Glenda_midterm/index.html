            <h2> A Public Transportation Blog by Glenda Hodges</h2>    
            <p>DePaul University Students, like many metropolitan Chicago college students have discovered that public transportation is <em>essential</em> to your survival. Most liberal arts classes are held at Lincoln Park. If you are a Business or CDM major, the Red and Brown lines are familiar friends. For me, a 29-year resident of Illinois, I had never ridden the bus or EL until attending DePaul.</p>

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I began my DePaul journey after graduating in 2017, from Elgin Community College with an Associate Degree in Graphic Design. One of my former community college classmates, then a current DePaul student encouraged me to apply. Thus, beginning my new journey with DePaul and public transportation. Prior to DePaul, I infrequently rode Metra to ride Amtrak to Michigan, shop, or attend daytime events. Like most people, <b>I own a car</b> and drive where I need to go. This blog will highlight photos and stories of some of my public transportation experiences.</p>
